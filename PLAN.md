# Flash Loans Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
The Flash Loans application is a Node.js project aimed at providing a platform for executing and monitoring flash loan transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing the power of Web3.js and Ethereum smart contracts, this application will offer real-time transaction capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

## Goals
1. **Functionality**: Develop a robust application that can execute and monitor flash loans efficiently.
2. **User Experience**: Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain.
3. **Security**: Ensure high levels of security in all transactions and smart contract interactions.
4. **Scalability**: Design the application to be scalable for future enhancements.
