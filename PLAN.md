# Flash Loans Application MVP Development Plan

## Project Overview
The Flash Loans MVP is a Node.js application designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to explore and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities through flash loans, leveraging real-time cryptocurrency pricing and smart contract interactions.

## MVP Features
1. **Ethereum Mainnet Connection**: Establish a connection to the Ethereum Mainnet using a Node provider.
2. **Secret Management**: Implement secure management of sensitive data like API keys and private keys.
3. **Block Subscription**: Subscribe to new blocks on the Ethereum Blockchain to monitor transactions in real-time.
4. **Cryptocurrency Pricing Polling**: Retrieve and normalize pricing data for two different cryptocurrencies.
5. **Arbitrage Evaluation**: Evaluate potential arbitrage opportunities between two cryptocurrencies.
6. **Flashloan Mechanism**: Implement the flashloan provider logic and smart contract.
7. **Truffle Project Setup**: Set up a Truffle project for smart contract deployment and testing.
8. **Smart Contract for Flashloan**: Develop a flashloan smart contract tailored for arbitrage.
9. **Exchange and Token Addresses**: Configure addresses for exchanges and tokens involved in arbitrage.
10. **Arbitrage Execution**: Develop logic for executing arbitrage (A to B and B to A scenarios).
11. **Profit Withdrawal**: Implement functionality to withdraw profits from arbitrage transactions.
12. **Transaction Initiation**: Send transactions to initiate flashloans as per arbitrage signals.
13. **Deployment and Testing**: Deploy the smart contract and application, and test the MVP on a fork of the Ethereum Mainnet.
14. **24/7 Operation on VPS**: Deploy the application on a Virtual Private Server for continuous operation.
15. **Expandability**: Add functionality to include additional tokens in the arbitrage strategy.
16. **Asset Liquidation**: Implement a feature to liquidate all assets when necessary.
